# PyScript
his tutorial will show you how to use the py-click attribute to handle mouse clicks on elements on your page. The py-click attribute is a special attribute that allows you to specify a Python function that will be called when the element is clicked. There are many other events such as 
- py-mouseover, 
- py-focus, 
- py-input, 
- py-keyress 
etc, which can be used as well. They are listed here Attr-to-Event
Let's add a button and a paragraph to the page. The button will have the py-click attribute, and the paragraph will have the id attribute. The id attribute is used to identify the element on the page, and the py-click attribute will be used to specify the function that will be called when the button is clicked.
